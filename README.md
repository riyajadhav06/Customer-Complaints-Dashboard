# Customer-Complaints-Dashboard
Power BI
I'm excited to share an example of a customer complaints dashboard I've been working on! This comprehensive view of customer complaints data provides valuable insights into complaint trends, resolution times, and customer satisfaction levels. By leveraging interactive visuals and filters, stakeholders can drill down into specific complaint categories and identify areas for improvement in customer service operations.

Key Highlights:

Total Complaints: 8,469
Complaints Resolved: 2,769
Trends Over Time: Detailed trends over 2020 and 2021
Complaints By Type: Billing inquiries, cancellation requests, product inquiries, refund requests, and technical issues.
Priority Levels: Breakdown by critical, high, medium, and low priority
Top Products: Identifies the top 5 products with the most complaints
Customer Satisfaction Rating: Visual representation of satisfaction levels
Complaint Channels: Distribution across chat, email, phone, and social media.

This dashboard is more than just a collection of data points; it's a strategic tool that empowers us to enhance our customer service operations and drive excellence.
